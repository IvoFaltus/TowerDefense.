Welcome to the Tower Defense Game!
You can play in Dynamic mode — knights move automatically, so think fast!
Your goal: Place towers to stop knights from reaching the finish line.
If a knight moves next to a tower (not diagonally), it attacks and damages it.
Once a tower’s health reaches zero, it is destroyed.
Survive as many waves as you can with smart tower placement!
